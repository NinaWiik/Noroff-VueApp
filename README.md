# Noroff VueApp


We need to install the Vue CLI to be able to use this VueApp. To install it, open the command line and run npm install -g @vue/cli if youâ€™re using npm.

Then CD into the Noroff VueApp folder and run the command "npm run serve". 
The project will then compile and nn server will be made inside the CLI to be used to watch the App.


  App running at:
  - Local:   http://localhost:8080/
  - Network: http://192.168.10.170:8080/

When the project is running, you get to an login page.
